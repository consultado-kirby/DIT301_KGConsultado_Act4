How did you implement event handing for user actions?

  - I implemented event handing using setOnClickListener() for
the Sumbit button, it makes the screen send a imeediate response
when the user clicks it. I used this so the app are interactive
and responsive.

What techniques ensured smooth and stable interaction?

  - For smooth and stable interaction, I used input validators,
clear error messages, and Toast notification for instant feedback.
It helps to prevent crashes and to tell the user what should do if
there is an error or mistake.

What improvements would you add in future version?

  - I want to add input formatting, better styling for elements,
simple smooth animations, and improved accessiblity features for
better user-experience.
